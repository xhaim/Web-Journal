      <h3>What is Augmemted Reality?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        Augmented reality is an interactive experience that enhances the real
        world with computer-generated perceptual information. Using software,
        apps, and hardware such as AR glasses, augmented reality overlays
        digital content onto real-life environments and objects.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world
        that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or
        other sensory stimuli and delivered via technology. It is a growing
        trend among companies involved in mobile computing and business
        applications in particular. Amid the rise of data collection and
        analysis, one of augmented reality’s primary goals is to highlight
        specific features of the physical world, increase understanding of those
        features, and derive smart and accessible insight that can be applied to
        real-world applications. Such big data can help inform companies’
        decision making and gain insight into consumer spending habits, among
        others.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Augmented reality continues to develop and become more pervasive among a
        wide range of applications. Since its conception, marketers and
        technology firms have had to battle the perception that augmented
        reality is little more than a marketing tool. However, there is evidence
        that consumers are beginning to derive tangible benefits from this
        technology and expect it as part of their purchasing process.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Some experts have long speculated that wearable devices could be a
        breakthrough for augmented reality. Smartphones and tablets show a tiny
        portion of the user’s landscape, but smart eyewear, for example, may
        provide a more complete link between real and virtual realms if it
        develops enough to become mainstream.
