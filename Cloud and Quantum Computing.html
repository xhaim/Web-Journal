      <h3>What is Cloud and Quantum Computing?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        A cloud quantum computer is a quantum computer that can be accessed in a
        cloud environment through a network. Today, there are numbers of cloud
        quantum computing services that can be accessed by users. They are used
        to solve complex problems that require powerful computing.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Quantum Computing?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        Quantum cloud computing makes quantum computing resources available to
        organizations, academics and other users through cloud technology.
        Cloud-based quantum computers function at greater speeds, with higher
        computing power than conventional computers, because they employ the
        principles of quantum physics when solving complex computational
        problems.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Different types of quantum computers exist, such as quantum annealers,
        analog quantum simulators and universal quantum computers. Quantum
        annealers are considered the least powerful among quantum computers but
        work well to solve optimization problems. Analog quantum simulators, on
        the other hand, are powerful systems that can solve physics and
        biochemistry problems. Universal quantum computers are the most powerful
        and widely used type of quantum computer. They are also the most
        difficult to build. Universal computing can potentially access up to 1
        million qubits (basic units of quantum information). However, the
        current technology can only access around 100 to 400 qubits.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is the difference between cloud computing and quantum cloud
        computing?
      </h3>
      <p class="indent">
        Quantum cloud computing employs quantum principles to distributed
        computing, while cloud computing uses remote servers to provide
        distributed computing services. Cloud computing simply refers to
        providing services such as data storage, servers, databases and
        networking via the internet. Instead of storing data on physical servers
        onsite, for example, an organization can opt for cloud storage services
        to cut hardware maintenance and other costs.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Quantum cloud computing, on the other hand, derives from quantum
        computing — a form of computing that uses quantum mechanics principles
        to solve complex problems. It provides quantum computers for users to
        access quantum-enabled services and solutions through the cloud.
        Companies using cloud computing, such as Google, Amazon, IBM and
        Microsoft, are also at the forefront of developing quantum computers to
        refine computing technology and enable more users to access quantum
        computers through the cloud. IBM’s Osprey quantum computer, for example,
        features 433 qubits. The company reportedly plans to scale up to 4,000
        qubits by 2025.
      </p>
      <h3>How does quantum cloud computing work?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        Akin to platform-as-a-service solutions, quantum cloud computing
        services work by connecting users directly to quantum processors,
        emulators and simulators. Physical quantum computers are very complex,
        making cloud-based access an ideal setup for those needing to harness
        the power of quantum computing without purchasing their own machine.
        According to IBM, its quantum hardware systems are roughly the size of
        an average car — mainly comprised of cooling systems to ensure that the
        superconducting processor remains at the ultra-cold ideal operating
        temperature. Quantum hardware systems consist of superfluids that work
        to super-cool the system; superconductors, which form a Josephson
        junction to carry charges through quantum tunneling; and qubits
        facilitating behavior control and information relay.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Qubits can perform an important function called superposition, which
        allows them to place the quantum information they hold in a state of
        superposition or a combination of all the possible configurations of the
        qubits. This phenomenon allows for the creation of multidimensional
        computational spaces, facilitating the solution of complex problems.
        Another thing that bears understanding when talking about quantum
        computing is the concept of entanglement — a quantum mechanical effect.
        Entanglement refers to correlations between the behavior of two separate
        things. In the context of quantum entanglement, as qubits become
        entangled, they cause changes to other qubits, allowing the system to
        find solutions faster than conventional computers. Contrary to the
        widespread but mistaken belief that quantum computing can solve complex
        problems by trying every possible configuration to a problem in
        parallel, quantum computers leverage qubit entanglement to explore
        probabilities. Then, they carry out an algorithm to increase the chances
        of coming up with the best possible answer.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the purpose of quantum cloud computing?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        Quantum computing can potentially solve previously intractable problems
        in various fields, such as economics, drug design and development,
        finance, logistics, and more. For example, large-scale quantum cloud
        computing platforms can be used to solve problems related to
        optimization in logistics and scheduling of resources in a business
        context. In healthcare, quantum cloud computing can potentially analyze
        large volumes of patient data to find the most effective treatments for
        specific illnesses.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Moreover, in the cybersecurity field, quantum computers can use their
        enhanced computing power to help combat cybercrime and data breaches.
        The benefits of quantum cloud computing are plenty. One significant
        benefit is that it allows organizations to access the power of quantum
        computing without purchasing their own machine and cooling systems. It
        also allows quantum researchers, such as quantum physics students and
        scholars, to understand quantum principles better, and perform
        experiments without physically needing to access a quantum computer.
