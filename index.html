      <p class="indent">
        Emerging technology is a term generally used to describe a new
        technology, but it may also refer to the continuing development of
        existing technology; it can have slightly different meanings when used
        in different areas, such as media, business, science, or education.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        ​​​​​ ​E​merging Technology Trends is a series of thematic publications
        on emerging technology. Every year a specific emerging technology, and
        its impact on development, is presented. The series promotes the wide
        scale deployment of emerging technology to contribute to the achievement
        of the Sustainable Development Goals. It also shared information on
        emerging technology and facilitate the implementation and use of ICT
        technologies when necessary. The Emerging Technology Trends series will
        also discuss the development and evolution of emerging technology in
        developing countries.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        The term commonly refers to technologies that are currently developing,
        or that are expected to be available within the next five to ten years,
        and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating or are
        expected to create significant social or economic effects. Technological
        evolution is a theory of radical transformation of society through
        technological development.

        The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and
        innovation that took place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. An
        Industrial Revolution at its core occurs when a society shifts from
        using tools to make products to use new sources of energy, such as coal,
        to power machines in factories. The revolution started in England, with
        a series of innovations to make labor more efficient and productive. The
        Industrial Revolution was a time when the manufacturing of goods moved
        from small shops and homes to large factories. This shift brought about
        changes in culture as people moved from rural areas to big cities in
        order to work.

        The American Industrial Revolution commonly referred to as the Second
        Industrial Revolution, started sometime between 1820 and 1870. The
        impact of changing the way items was manufactured had a wide reach.
        Industries such as textile manufacturing, mining, glass making, and
        agriculture all had undergone changes. For example, prior to the
        Industrial Revolution, textiles were primarily made of wool and were
        handspun.

        From the first industrial revolution (mechanization through water and
        steam power) to the mass production and assembly lines using electricity
        in the second, the fourth industrial revolution will take what was
        started in the third with the adoption of computers and automation and
        enhance it with smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine
        learning.

        Generally, the following industrial revolutions fundamentally changed
        and transfer the world around us into modern society.
