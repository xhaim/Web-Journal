      <h3>What is Internet of Things ?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical
        objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other
        technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with
        other devices and systems over the internet.These devices range from
        ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more
        than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this
        number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is Internet of Things (IoT) so important?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important
        technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday
        objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the
        internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible
        between people, processes, and things.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and
        mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with
        minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital
        systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between
        connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they
        cooperate.
      </p>
      <h3>What technologies have made IoT possible?</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a
        collection of recent advances in a number of different technologies has
        made it practical.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b> Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology</b>. Affordable
          and reliable sensors are making IoT technology possible for more
          manufacturers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Connectivity</b>. A host of network protocols for the internet has made it
          easy to connect sensors to the cloud and to other “things” for
          efficient data transfer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cloud computing platforms</b>. The increase in the availability of cloud
          platforms enables both businesses and consumers to access the
          infrastructure they need to scale up without actually having to manage
          it all.
        </li>
        <li>
         <b>Machine learning and analytics </b> . With advances in machine learning and
          analytics, along with access to varied and vast amounts of data stored
          in the cloud, businesses can gather insights faster and more easily.
          The emergence of these allied technologies continues to push the
          boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also feeds these
          technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) </b>. Advances in neural
          networks have brought natural-language processing (NLP) to IoT devices
          (such as digital personal assistants Alexa, Cortana, and Siri) and
          made them appealing, affordable, and viable for home use.
